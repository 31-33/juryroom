`members`: *Array of user id's, each corresponding to an entry in the Users collection.*

`scenarioSetId`: *The set of scenarios that this group is to discuss.*

`discussions`: *Array of objects, each representing a discussion carried out by this group. Each entry in this array stores the `scenarioId` and the `discussionId` for the discussion.*

            commentId: String,
            dateTime: Date,
        },
    ],

    activeVote: String?,
    status: String,
}
```

`_id`: *The unique identifier for this discussion.*

`scenarioId`: *Identifier for the scenario for this discussion.*

`createdAt`: *ISODate object representing the UTC time at which this discussion thread was created.*

`groupId`: *String which identifies the group which is participating in this discussion.*

`activeReplies`: *Stores which replies are currently being replied to (and by which users). `parentId` may be an empty string, representing a root level comment is being made. This is used to store the current state of new posts/repliesâ€”there should only be one entry for each `userId`.*

`userStars`: *Stores which comments are currently starred (and by which users). Each user can only have one comment starred at a time, and therefore there should only be one entry for each `userId`.*

`actionStar`: *Stores the full history of every star action made on this discussion thread. A star action consists of the `userId` who made the action, the `commentId` of the starred comment (not defined in the case of un-starring), and the `dateTime` the action was made at*.

`actionReply`: *Stores the full history of every active reply made by the user. A reply action consists of the `userId` who made the action, the `parentId` of the comment being replied to (an empty string represents a root-level comment, and undefined represents the reply window being closed), and the `dateTime` the action was made at.*

`actionCollapse`: *Stores the full history of every comment that was collapsed/uncollapsed by a user participating in this discussion. Consists of the `userId` making the action, the `commentId` being collapsed, a boolean (`collapsed`) specifying whether the action was collapsing or uncollapsing the comment, and the `dateTime` at which the action was made. **Note: State of which users currently have a comment collapsed is stored on the comment itself.***

`votes`: *Stores a collection of votes made within this discussion. Each item in this collection is a string, which uniquely identifies an entry in the Votes collection. More detail about the vote may be found there.*

`activeVote`: *The currently active vote for this discussion. Undefined if/when no active vote is taking place.*

`status`: *String representing the state the discussion is currently in. Possible values are `active` when discussion is in progress, `voting` when a vote is in progress (this should restrict other actions), and `finished` when the discussion is completed.*
