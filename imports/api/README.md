## Discussion
Represents a discussion thread. A discussion is a conversation between a group of users, about a given scenario.

```
{
    _id: String,
    created_at: Date,
    group_id: String,
    active_replies: [
        {
            user_id: String,
            parent_id: String,
        },
    ],
    user_stars: [
        {
            user_id: String,
            comment_id: String,
        },
    ],
    action_star: [
        {
            user_id: String,
            comment_id: String,
            date_time: Date,
        },
    ],
    action_reply: [
        {
            user_id: String,
            date_time: Date,
            parent_id: String?,
        },
    ],
    action_collapse: [
        {
            user_id: String,
            comment_id: String,
            collapsed: Boolean,
            date_time: Date,
        },
    ],
    votes: [String],
    active_vote: String?,
}
```

`_id`: *The unique identifier for this discussion.*

`created_at`: *ISODate object representing the UTC time at which this discussion thread was created.*

`group_id`: *String which identifies the group which is participating in this discussion.*

`active_replies`: *Stores which replies are currently being replied to (and by which users). `parent_id` may be an empty string, representing a root level comment is being made. This is used to store the current state of new posts/repliesâ€”there should only be one entry for each `user_id`.*

`user_stars`: *Stores which comments are currently starred (and by which users). Each user can only have one comment starred at a time, and therefore there should only be one entry for each `user_id`.*

`action_star`: *Stores the full history of every star action made on this discussion thread. A star action consists of the `user_id` who made the action, the `comment_id` of the starred comment (not defined in the case of un-starring), and the `date_time` the action was made at*.

`action_reply`: *Stores the full history of every active reply made by the user. A reply action consists of the `user_id` who made the action, the `parent_id` of the comment being replied to (an empty string represents a root-level comment, and undefined represents the reply window being closed), and the `date_time` the action was made at.*

`action_collapse`: *Stores the full history of every comment that was collapsed/uncollapsed by a user participating in this discussion. Consists of the `user_id` making the action, the `comment_id` being collapsed, a boolean (`collapsed`) specifying whether the action was collapsing or uncollapsing the comment, and the `date_time` at which the action was made. **Note: State of which users currently have a comment collapsed is stored on the comment itself.***

`votes`: *Stores a collection of votes made within this discussion. Each item in this collection is a string, which uniquely identifies an entry in the Votes collection. More detail about the vote may be found there.*

---
## Scenario

    posted_time: Date,
    author_id: String,
    text: String,
    collapsed: [String],
}
```

`_id`: *The unique identifier for this comment.*

`discussion_id`: *Uniquely identifies the entry in the Discussions collection, to which this comment belongs.*

`parent_id`: *Uniquely identifies another entry within the Comments collection, to which this comment is a reply to. This field may also be an empty string, representing comments which are posted at the root-level.*

`posted_time`: *ISODate object representing the UTC time when this comment was posted.*

    comment_id: String,
    discussion_id: String,
    user_votes: [
        {

`comment_id`: *Identifies the comment which this vote was called upon.*

`discussion_id`: *Identifies the discussion which this vote (and associated comment) exist within.*
